# Heart-disease-prediction
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Today,
cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide with 17.9
million deaths annually, as per the World Health Organization reports.

Various unhealthy activities are the reason for the increase in the risk of heart
disease like high cholesterol, obesity, increase in triglycerides levels,
hypertension, etc. All these symptoms resemble different diseases also like it
occurs in the aging persons, so it becomes a difficult task to get a correct
diagnosis, which results in fatality in near future.

The objective of this project is to be able to accurately classify as having or not
having heart disease based on diagnostic test data. We have made use of the
Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease dataset which contains 13 variables related to
patient diagnostics and one outcome variable indicating the presence or absence
of heart disease. We have used logistic regression to make prediction regarding
heart disease.
